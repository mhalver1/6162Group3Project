We want to work with soil, which has many parameters that can affect what model can be used. These parameters include things like texture and porosity. The problem question we would like to solve is which model is best used analyze and describe soil quality datasets. These datasets will consist of different soil parameters. We will perform data analysis and use learning techniques to accomplish analyzing which models are best used to analyze soil. The problem question we would like to solve is how accurate is the data we analyze and if the data is trustworthy. Future work involves looking into the best supervised and unsupervised learning techniques that can be used as well as well as researching different datasets to use for the project.
